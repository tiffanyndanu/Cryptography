## Understanding the context
An online cryptography course has been created by a Kenyan businesswoman, and she would want to promote it on her blog. She is currently targeting consumers from a variety of countries. She had previously used the same blog to run advertising for a related course, collecting data in the process. She'd like to hire you as a Data Science Consultant to assist her in determining which people are most likely to click on her adverts.

## Experimental design
1.  Import the data 
2.  Perform data exploration
3.  Perform Univariate and Bivariate data Analysis
4.  Provide conclusion
